Email Component Template: Streamlining Design and Development
When starting with a new brand, I create a comprehensive template housing both existing and improved email components. This approach offers several advantages:

- Quick Reference: Easily access and implement proven components.
- Continuous Improvement: New creations are added, expanding the template's utility.
- Time Efficiency: Reduce development time by reusing pre-built elements.
- Compatibility: Ensure 100% MJML compatibility for wider email client support.
- Versatility: Maintained in both HTML and MJML versions.

This template serves as a dynamic starting point, containing base components that are customized and expanded for each brand's unique needs. 
While compact initially, it grows into a robust resource of diverse, styled elements ready for implementation across various email campaigns.
